<!-- The first part of this challenge is to make the first 2 tests pass by:

1. Creating an unordered list 
2. Nesting each grilled cheese ingredient as a list item wrapped in `<li>` tags

Start up `httpserver` or open `index.html` in your browser. Let's say we wanted
to list out the ingredients required for making a grilled cheese sandwich.  The
ingredients are: `2 slices of bread`, `4 slices of cheese`, `1 tbsp of butter`.

For the first part of this challenge, in `index.html`, create an unordered list
that displays these ingredients. Run `learn` to see if you can pass the first
test. If you've done things correctly, you'll now be passing the first test,
but there are more tests to pass! We now need to turn our attention to the next
test.

Okay, now, lets say we wanted to make our grilled cheese a little more exciting
and add a couple of cheeses, `cheddar`, `mozzarella`, and `pepper jack`.

To pass the second test, inside the `li` of `4 slices of cheese`, add a nested
unordered list that lists out the three types of cheese.

If your first two tests are passing, great! It's time to talk about another type
of list!

## Introduce the Ordered List Tag

Unordered lists are great for organizing related content where it doesn't matter
what goes first, like in our grilled cheese ingredients.  In situations where we
_want_ items to be displayed in a specific, numbered order, we will want to use
the _ordered list_ tag, which is written as `<ol>` instead of `<ul>`. Both use
`<li>` tags inside, but this time, `<ol>` will display a numbered list instead
of bullets. If say, we wanted to write a _ranked_ list of favorite foods, it
might look like:

```HTML
<h3>Top 5 Favorite Foods</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Grilled Cheese</li>
  <li>Sushi</li>
  <li>Cheese and crackers</li>
  <li>Cheese soup</li>
  <li>Nacho Cheese French Fries</li>
</ol>
```

> Feel free to test this out by adding it to `index.html`, saving and refreshing
> the tab where the file is open. Now, `Grilled Cheese` will be displayed as `1.
> Grilled Cheese` as the #1 food (where it belongs).

Nested ordered lists works the same as unordered, but instead of hollow and
square bullets, each nested list will still display numbers.

**Note:** In a nested list, you _must_ provide the `ol` or `ul` wrapper.  Otherwise, an
`li` inside another `li` will just be displayed as two items at the same level.
This is because technically, you do not need to write a closing `li` tag.  The
following example will be displayed the same as the previous:

```HTML
<h3>Top 5 Favorite Foods</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Grilled Cheese
  <li>Sushi
  <li>Cheese and crackers
  <li>Cheese soup
  <li>Nacho Cheese French Fries
</ol>
```

## Reinforce Our Understanding Of Ordered Lists Through Creation

To complete the challenge write the necessary HTML to pass the tests:

3. Create an ordered list 
4. Nest each step for creating grilled cheese as a list item wrapped in `<li>` tags

Okay, so we've got our grilled cheese ingredients, but what about the steps
requires to make a grilled cheese? Steps to a recipe need to be
in order, otherwise we may end up with burnt cheese covered in bread and topped
with a square of butter. The steps to making a basic grilled cheese would be:
`Spread butter on bread and frying pan`, `Place bread in frying pan and fry`,
`Add cheese on top of bread`, `Cover with second slice of bread`, `Turn over and
fry for 2 minutes`

***
Once you've written an ordered list that displays these 5 steps correctly, run `learn` 
to see the tests pass. -->
